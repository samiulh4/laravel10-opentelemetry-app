# composer require open-telemetry/opentelemetry:^1.0

`The open-telemetry/opentelemetry package is the core PHP implementation of the OpenTelemetry project. 
This package provides an API and SDK that help developers instrument their applications to collect telemetry data, 
which includes traces, metrics, and logs, for observability purposes.`

# composer require open-telemetry/sdk:^1.0

`The open-telemetry/sdk package is the official PHP SDK for OpenTelemetry, an open-source observability framework. 
It provides the necessary tools and libraries for instrumenting applications to collect telemetry data (traces, metrics, and logs) 
that helps monitor and debug distributed systems.`

# composer require open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php-contrib:^0.0.17

`This package includes pre-built instrumentations and integrations that extend OpenTelemetry in PHP applications. It helps with automatic tracing of libraries, frameworks, or services like databases, HTTP requests, etc., in line with OpenTelemetry standards.
By running this command, you ensure your project includes version 0.0.17 or a compatible one, allowing you to integrate tracing without having to manually implement all aspects of OpenTelemetry instrumentation.`

# composer require open-telemetry/exporter-zipkin:^1.0

`This package integrates the Zipkin exporter with OpenTelemetry. It enables your PHP application to export trace data to a Zipkin server for visualization and analysis. Zipkin helps in tracking and troubleshooting latency issues in distributed systems, and this package allows OpenTelemetry to use Zipkin as a destination for trace data.
In an application where you're using OpenTelemetry for tracing, adding this package allows you to send trace data to a Zipkin backend. If you already have Zipkin running as part of your observability stack, this exporter makes it easy to monitor your PHP application's performance and trace distributed requests across services.`

# composer require openzipkin/zipkin:^3.2

`This package integrates Zipkin with your PHP application, enabling it to send trace data directly to a Zipkin backend. The package provides classes and methods to create spans, manage trace contexts, and send tracing information to Zipkinâ€™s collector.
Use Case

In a microservices or distributed application, you would use this package to:

    Instrument your PHP application to track the lifecycle of a request across services.
    Collect data about request latencies, errors, and other performance metrics.
    Send trace data to a Zipkin server, where you can visualize and analyze the distributed system's performance.

This package is useful if you're building or maintaining a system with multiple services and you need observability tools to diagnose latency, bottlenecks, and errors across services.`
